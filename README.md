DueTimer
========

Timer Library for the Arduino Due.

The features of this library have been merged and added to ivanseidel's library, which can be found here: https://github.com/ivanseidel/DueTimer

That has all the features this one has, but it is implemented using the object oriented approach that is more compliant with existing Arduino libraries.

You are welcome to keep using this one, but ivanseidel's will be better kept up to date.

If there is any reason you feel that this library offers something that is missing from the other, please let me know and I will try and merge that feature into his library.

Thanks!
